# Datasets for Sentiment Analysis

A repo of benchmark datasets for sentiment analysis: 

## IMDb dataset

Large Movie Review Dataset. This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing substantially more data than previous benchmark datasets. We provide a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training, and 25,000 for testing. There is additional unlabeled data for use as well.

```python
def hello():
    print("Hello, World!")
